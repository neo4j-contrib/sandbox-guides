      <div class="paragraph">
<p>Each row in the CSV file represents a contract that has been awarded to an organization, issued by a federal government agency (actually each row represents a <strong>transaction</strong>, and we could have multiple transactions per contract, but let&#8217;s simplify our thinking and just think of each row as a contract).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking at the data dictionary we can see that each row has <strong>a lot</strong> of fields (225 actually!), so there is a lot of information encoded in each row. We are mainly interested in:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What organization was awarded the contract?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the parent organization of the awardee (is it a subsidiary)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of the contract</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agency issuing the contract</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the contract</p>

    <h3>MATCHing on organizations</h3>

      <div class="paragraph">
<p>So here we can see some contracts that were issued by the Federal Prison System to various vendors. Now we could certainly import the entire dataset into Neo4j and run some interesting queries for analysis, but we&#8217;re specifically interested in finding contracts that were awarded to vendors that appear in the Trumpworld dataset. Let&#8217;s see if we can find any. To do this we need to <code>MATCH</code> on <code>Organization</code> nodes where the <code>name</code> property of the organization is equal to the <code>vendorname</code> column in the CSV file. We have to look through 5000 rows before we find a match:</p>

<p>We can see that in this case the <code>vendor_name</code> and <code>parent_org</code> values are the same. This means that Duke University isn&#8217;t part of larger organization. Parent company information is provided by Dun &amp; Bradstreet. We are also interested in finding contracts that were awarded to subsidiaries of companies in Trumpworld, as this would also help us identify potential conflicts of interest. To find these contracts (one that was awarded to a vendor where the vendor is a subsidiary of a company that appears in Trumpworld) we&#8217;ll need to match on <code>Organization</code> nodes where the <code>name</code> property is equal to the <code>parent_org</code> column and where the <code>vendor_name</code> is not equal to <code>parent_org</code>. To find examples of these we need to look through a few more rows - the first 50000 (but don&#8217;t worry there are more than 4 million rows in this CSV file!):</p>
