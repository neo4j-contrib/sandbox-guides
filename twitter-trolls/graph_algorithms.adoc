== Inferred Relationships

++++
<div class="col-lg-9">
++++

Inferred relationships are important in graphs. For example, when a Troll account retweets another Troll's tweet we could say the trolls have an inferred *"AMPLIFIED"* relationship: one troll is amplifying the message of the other.

.Inferred AMPLIFIED relationships exist when a troll account retweets another troll

== Graph Algorithms

link:https://neo4j.com/graph-analytics/[Graph algorithms^] are a way to apply analytics to the entire graph to further enhance our understanding of the data. These algorithms fall into three categories: 

* **Centrality** - What are the most important nodes in the network? _PageRank, Betweenness Centrality, Closeness Centrality_
* **Community detection** - How can the graph be partitioned? _Union Find, Louvain, Label Propagation, Connected Components_
* **Pathfinding** - What are the shortest paths or best routes available given cost? _Minimum Weight Spanning Tree, All Pairs- and Single Source- Shortest Path, Dijkstra_

We can run these algorithms in Neo4j with Cypher using the link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms[Neo4j Graph Algorithms^] procedures.

Let's run PageRank over this inferred AMPLIFIED graph to find the most influential trolls

.Run PageRank over the inferred troll amplification graph. This will write the results back to a pagerank property on the nodes
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank("MATCH (t:Troll) RETURN id(t) AS id","MATCH (r1:Troll)-[:POSTED]->(:Tweet)<-[:RETWEETED]-(:Tweet)<-[:POSTED]-(r2:Troll) RETURN id(r2) as source, id(r1) as target", {graph:'cypher'})
----

.Find Trolls with highest PageRank score
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t:Troll) WHERE EXISTS(t.pagerank)
RETURN t.screen_name AS troll, t.pagerank AS pagerank ORDER BY pagerank DESC LIMIT 25
----

.What are the top trolls tweeting about?
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t:Troll) WHERE EXISTS(t.pagerank)
WITH t ORDER BY t.pagerank LIMIT 25
MATCH (t)-[:POSTED]->(tw:Tweet)-[:HAS_TAG]-(ht:Hashtag)
RETURN ht.tag, COUNT(tw) AS num ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 25

PageRank is a recursive graph algorithm that defines the importance of a node proportional to the importance and number of connected nodes in the graph.

== Community Detection

++++
<div class="col-lg-9">
++++

We can also run community detection over this inferred AMPLIFIED graph to see how the graph is partitioned

.Partition the graph into communities using the Label Propagation algorithm. An additional property `community` is added to each node specifying the community it has been assgined to by the algorithm.
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.labelPropagation("MATCH (t:Troll) RETURN id(t) AS id","MATCH (r1:Troll)-[:POSTED]->(t:Tweet)<-[:RETWEETED]-(:Tweet)<-[:POSTED]-(r2:Troll) RETURN id(r2) AS source, id(r1) AS target, COUNT(t) AS weight","OUTGOING",   {graph:'cypher', write: true, iterations: 200})
----

We can then see which Trolls were assigned to each community:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t:Troll) WHERE EXISTS(t.partition)
RETURN COLLECT(t.screen_name) AS members, t.partition AS community
ORDER BY SIZE(members) DESC LIMIT 10
----

And finally, we can see if there are certain themes that each community was focused on, by inspecting the most common hashtags used by each community:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t:Troll) WHERE EXISTS(t.partition)
WITH COLLECT(t) AS members, t.partition AS community
ORDER BY SIZE(members) DESC LIMIT 10
UNWIND members AS t
MATCH (t)-[:POSTED]->(tw:Tweet)-[:HAS_TAG]->(ht:Hashtag)
WITH community, ht.tag AS tag, COUNT(tw) AS num ORDER BY num DESC
RETURN community, COLLECT(tag)[..10] AS toptags
LIMIT 10

== Graph Visualization

++++
<div class="col-lg-6">
++++

Graph visualization is an important tool for interpreting the results of graph algorithms. Specifically:

* *Node size* relative to *centrality*
* Node color specific to community detection
* Relationship thickness relative to weight

Try using Neovis.js to visualize the results of the graph algorithms we just ran link:http://heuristic-mccarthy-6d9e00.netlify.com/examples/trolls.html[here.]
