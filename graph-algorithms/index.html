    <h3>Graph of Character Interactions</h3>
    <br/>
    <div>
      <div class="paragraph">
<p>Andrew built a graph where nodes are characters in the TV series and relationships represent character interactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Characters have a relationship for each time their names (or nicknames) <strong>appear within 15 words of one another</strong>.
Each link corresponds to an interaction between the two characters. Note that this interaction could be direct or indirect. Here are some of the types of interactions that our method picks up.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two characters appearing together in the same location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two characters in conversation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One character talking about another character</p>
</li>

    <h3>PageRank</h3>
    <br/>
    <div>
      <div class="paragraph">
<p>This is another version of weighted degree centrality with a feedback loop. This time, you only get your “fair share” of your neighbor’s importance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>i.e. your neighbor’s importance is split between their neighbors, proportional to the number of interactions with that neighbor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intuitively, PageRank captures how effectively you are taking advantage of your network contacts.
In our context, PageRank centrality nicely captures narrative tension. Indeed, major developments occur when two important characters interact.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice that there are some characters who have a high page rank but a very low betweenness centrality score.</p>

<p>This suggests that they aren&#8217;t necessarily influential in their own right, but are friends with important people.
