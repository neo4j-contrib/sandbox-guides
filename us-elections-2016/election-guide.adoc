We can compute the total votes per state upfront and use that to compute percentages.

== Use Cases

=== Results at county level

[source,cypher]
----
match (s:State {state:"CA"})<-[:IN_STATE]-(a:Area)<--(v:Vote)--(i:Issue)
where a.name = "San Francisco"
// and s.race='P'
return s.race, i.name,v.votes*s.reporting;
----

=== Results at state level

[source,cypher]
----
match (s:State {state:"CA"})<--(v:Vote)--(i:Issue)
return s.race, i.name,(v.votes)*s.reporting as votes, v.votes, s.college, v.percent
order by votes desc;

=== Results at Congressional district level

== Turnout

First, we need to determine the “Voting-Eligible Population” for each state. This is the number of residents over the age of 18, adjusted for non-eligible

[source,cypher]
----
// source: http://www.electproject.org/2016g
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///populations.csv" AS row
MATCH (s:State {name: row.State})
SET s.voting_eligible_pop = row.`Voting-Eligible Population (VEP)`;
----

== SQL Comparison Queries

=== List all U.S. House races and candidates:

.SQL
----
SELECT DISTINCT RaceCountyTable.SeatNumber, RaceCountyTable.OfficeName, RaceCountyTable.SeatName, CandidateTable.FirstName, CandidateTable.LastName FROM RaceCountyTable, ResultsTable, CandidateTable WHERE RaceCountyTable.OfficeID = 'H' AND
RaceCountyTable.RaceCountyID = ResultsTable.RaceCountyID AND ResultsTable.CandidateID = CandidateTable.CandidateID
ORDER BY RaceCountyTable.SeatNumber
